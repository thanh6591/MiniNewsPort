#### Scenario: Invalid credentials
- **WHEN** the admin submits invalid credentials
- **THEN** the page shows an inline error "Invalid username or password" and the user remains on the login page

#### Scenario: Already authenticated user opens login
- **WHEN** an admin with a valid JWT opens `/admin/login`
- **THEN** the system redirects to `/admin`

### Requirement: Admin logout clears session
The system SHALL provide a logout action that clears the JWT cookie and redirects to `/admin/login`.

#### Scenario: Logout from admin shell
- **WHEN** the admin clicks "Logout"
- **THEN** the JWT cookie is cleared and subsequent requests to admin pages redirect to `/admin/login`

### Requirement: Protected admin routes

#### Scenario: Unauthenticated user accesses admin
